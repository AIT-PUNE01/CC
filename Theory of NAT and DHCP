A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications like a physical machine. 
Each virtual machine typically runs its own guest operating system, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, or others. 
The guest operating system interacts with the virtual hardware provided by the virtualization software, including virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.

NAT networking allows VMs to share the host computer's IP address and access external networks through NAT.
Enable DHCP on the NAT network to automatically assign IP addresses to the VMs. 
find this information within the network settings or by running commands like ifconfig 
Set up file sharing or transfer protocols on both VMs. You can use protocols like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
VMs can communicate with each other over the NAT network by pinging each other's IP addresses.

ifconfig is a command-line utility used to configure network interfaces on a Unix-like operating system.
